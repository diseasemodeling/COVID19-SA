# COVID-19 simulation (v2)- An Interactive Tool for Analyses of Phased Reopening Decisions

## About - Version 2  [Run model (link)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1c-abLtgDlDz4YNLw9WU1f0DvQil1RQEd?authuser=1#) 
Key features 
1. An interactive user-friendly simulation tool 
2. Evaluate upto daily changes in options for social distancing, contact tracing and testing, and universal testing - Application to the State of New York. 
3. Allows comparative analyses of muliple alternative decision scenarios
4. Flexibility in setting analyses time-period, and option to change unit costs

## Model download and info
 
   - [Model on GitHub](https://github.com/diseasemodeling/COVID19-v2) 
   - [Methodology](Methodology-v2.pdf) 
   - Sample run [Sample user-entered decision](samples/Sample-Decision.png)- [Corresponding results](samples/SampleRun-results.pdf) Compares 2 scenarios: 
      a) Maximum contact reduction (only essential services open) \
      b) Phasing out social distancing, while combining with increased contact tracing and testing.
